## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.uah.edu/eng/departments/ece) at [The University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu). I received my Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu). Prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UT Arlington, I also worked in industry for several years as a software engineer.

My research focuses on the intersection of Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. Specifically, I am dedicated to creating comprehensive security testing tools that leverage advanced software engineering methodologies. These tools aim to enhance the security analysis of IoT ecosystems, modern compilers and ad-hoc ecosystems.
